# Forever Wave dApp Front-End

This is the front-end code for the Forever Wave dApp.

Through this dApp you'll be able to wave to the creator, send messages and view all everybody else's. There's also a chance you'll win some Rinkeby test Eth ðŸ˜€. Be careful what you write as your message will be recorded forever on the chain! Muhaha!

Forever Wave lives on Ethereum's Rinkeby Test Network. Never send real Eth to your testnet address. If you did, you would lose it. [Testnets](https://medium.com/compound-finance/the-beginners-guide-to-using-an-ethereum-test-network-95bbbc85fc1d) use test Eth which you can get for free from [Chainlink](https://faucets.chain.link/rinkeby) or other faucets. It is recommended that you create a separate wallet for use on test networks.
